While Joseph has made efforts to enhance his performance since his last review on July 13th, he has faced challenges in maintaining consistent improvement. Issues pertaining to Joseph's timeliness and attention to detail persistently affect the quality of his deliverables. His participation in crucial meetings, where concerns regarding attentiveness and engagement have arisen, as well as his responsibilities in addressing support and QA-related matters, continue to be areas of concern.

On TOPS days, during a crucial all-hands meeting featuring our CEO, Bob, Joseph fell asleep. Jenne, our CTO, noticed this and discreetly woke him, leading him outside to address it. Notably, this was not the first time Joseph had fallen asleep during a meeting, emphasizing a recurring issue. This incident underscored the need for professionalism during company gatherings and was considered disrespectful.
Timeliness continues to be an issue with Joseph's performance. Vulnerability reports, which were due before the month's meeting, were not completed for the month of August. Additionally, revisions to the documentation for the 'Headshots' and 'Tombstones' apps required numerous iterations and consumed a significant amount of time.


The support provided to address 'BAR' issues fell short of expectations on several fronts. Notably, this support was crucial as it was intended to assist with a production issue, making timely and effective communication a priority. 
Unfortunately, we encountered lapses in this aspect, with limited responsiveness and progress updates being communicated. Furthermore, the yearly password reset activities were not executed comprehensively, resulting in services failing on the servers. 
Joseph collaborated with Microsoft to resolve BAR's QA environment issues. Regrettably, critical validation checks, essential for ensuring the effectiveness of our solutions, were neglected. This oversight could have led to missed SLAs if it had not been remediated by Mohammed before the start of the next day."

Improvements and break-fixes to the Headshots app and Tombstones app encountered multiple issues, significantly impeding the seamless operation of these solutions. One of the key challenges was Joseph's failure to conduct comprehensive testing and functional validation of the improvements, which subsequently led to critical issues within the app.



Since the verbal warning was issued, the following tasks were assigned to Joseph:

Architectural documents and overview with the extended team: Unfortunately, Joseph continued to struggle with independently delivering comprehensively thought through work. Despite receiving feedback from team discussions, the necessary improvements were not incorporated during the follow-up meeting.

Hub2.0 usage reports: The task had to be redone multiple times due to a lack of basic troubleshooting and attention to detail. Joseph's failure to address these fundamental aspects resulted in repeated revisions.

Rearchitecture for Headshots User Profile Data: Despite being assigned this task 1.5 weeks ago, Joseph has made little meaningful progress. This lack of progress indicates a significant delay in completing the assignment.

Improvement plan discussions: No discussions have been scheduled to establish an improvement plan and track Joseph's performance after the verbal warning. This lack of proactive action hampers the opportunity to monitor and support Joseph in their efforts to improve their performance.





During our Monday afternoon 1:1 sessions, we regularly discussed Joseph's performance issues. However, on May 22nd, 2023, a formal verbal warning was delivered to Joseph, and the following points were discussed during the conversation:

Development opportunities: Joseph's performance review highlighted specific areas where improvement was needed. It was discussed how these same issues continue to hinder Joseph's professional deliveries, preventing them from reaching the expected outcomes.

Specific instances: We discussed individual instances where there was a significant gap between Joseph's delivered results and the expected outcomes. These instances served as examples to illustrate how Joseph could have successfully completed the tasks with better performance.

Improvement plan: It was emphasized that an improvement plan is necessary to quantitatively track Joseph's progress. Joseph was assigned the task of drafting the initial version of this plan, outlining specific actions and measurable goals for improvement.

Corrective Action Process: It was important to highlight that this conversation marked the first step in our organization's Corrective Action Process. It was emphasized that failure to demonstrate quantitative improvements within the specified timeframe could result in a written warning and, ultimately, termination.
