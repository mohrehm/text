None \ End Use only			
Out-of-the-box use of software refers to utilizing a pre-packaged solution without any configuration, allowing quick and easy deployment in its default state.


COTS Configuration			
This involves leveraging the software's user interface to utilize its built-in capabilities for tailoring and adapting the software to meet specific business requirements.

Low Code \ No Code			
Utilize the visual drag-and-drop capabilities of a software platform to create applications without the need for traditional coding. It enables users to build applications from scratch, starting with a blank canvas, by employing intuitive visual interfaces that offer basic logic and drag-and-drop functionality.


Scripting \ Automation			
Involve writing code specifically for limited, isolated tasks that complement an existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) application. This code focuses on specific, targeted functionalities and operates alongside the broader COTS application, serving a minimal role in comparison to the overall scope of the COTS application.



COTS Customization			
 refers to the process of modifying COTS application to meet specific requirements or preferences. It involves making changes to the application's functionality, user interface, configuration settings, or other aspects to align it with the unique needs of an organization. It tailors the software to specific use cases without having to develop a completely new solution from scratch. It can involve altering code, configurations, or settings within the constraints and guidelines provided by the software vendor.


Software Eng - In House Dev			
involves using internal resources to design, develop, and deploy custom software solutions tailored to its specific needs.





Since the verbal warning was issued, the following tasks were assigned to Joseph:

Architectural documents and overview with the extended team: Unfortunately, Joseph continued to struggle with independently delivering comprehensively thought through work. Despite receiving feedback from team discussions, the necessary improvements were not incorporated during the follow-up meeting.

Hub2.0 usage reports: The task had to be redone multiple times due to a lack of basic troubleshooting and attention to detail. Joseph's failure to address these fundamental aspects resulted in repeated revisions.

Rearchitecture for Headshots User Profile Data: Despite being assigned this task 1.5 weeks ago, Joseph has made little meaningful progress. This lack of progress indicates a significant delay in completing the assignment.

Improvement plan discussions: No discussions have been scheduled to establish an improvement plan and track Joseph's performance after the verbal warning. This lack of proactive action hampers the opportunity to monitor and support Joseph in their efforts to improve their performance.





During our Monday afternoon 1:1 sessions, we regularly discussed Joseph's performance issues. However, on May 22nd, 2023, a formal verbal warning was delivered to Joseph, and the following points were discussed during the conversation:

Development opportunities: Joseph's performance review highlighted specific areas where improvement was needed. It was discussed how these same issues continue to hinder Joseph's professional deliveries, preventing them from reaching the expected outcomes.

Specific instances: We discussed individual instances where there was a significant gap between Joseph's delivered results and the expected outcomes. These instances served as examples to illustrate how Joseph could have successfully completed the tasks with better performance.

Improvement plan: It was emphasized that an improvement plan is necessary to quantitatively track Joseph's progress. Joseph was assigned the task of drafting the initial version of this plan, outlining specific actions and measurable goals for improvement.

Corrective Action Process: It was important to highlight that this conversation marked the first step in our organization's Corrective Action Process. It was emphasized that failure to demonstrate quantitative improvements within the specified timeframe could result in a written warning and, ultimately, termination.
