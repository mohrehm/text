On May 19, 2023, the default sharing setting in SharePoint will change. Instead of sharing files and folders with anyone who has the link, you will only be able to share them with people who are already part of your organization and have been invited to view them.


Joseph often fails to communicate the status of his deliverables. He does not keep others updated on his progress, and has been missing deadlines. This was a key development area highlighted during their performance review and no improventments have been observed. the following are instances where lapse of communication has been pronounce.
1- Team discussions 
	- Limited to no contributions during January 25th TOPS Strategy Development Session. 
	- TOPS Team SP Discussion Meeting (April 25th) went on for 45 minutes before the presenter realize that the room was on mute and Joseph couldnt hear the on going conversation.
2- Missed deliverablesstreamgovernanceTOPS Team SP Discussion 
	- Incomplete link correction task

	- Overlooking directions given 
		- for Architecture documents
		- for SharePoint Hub bookmarks - promoted links
	- Hub 2.0 Go-Live weekend testing
	- Incomplete/Incorrect deliverables during Protected Vacation security group reconnaisance
3- No visible efforts towards technical improvements.


Joseph, as a senior technical resource, demonstrates diligence in his work and possesses the potential to deliver good results. However, his failure to address the development areas identified during his performance review is having a negative impact on our team's overall performance.

One of Joseph's primary areas for improvement is effective communication. Unfortunately, he frequently neglects to communicate the status of his deliverables, leading to incomplete tasks and confusion regarding the necessary actions. Despite being previously informed about this issue, Joseph has not shown any noticeable improvements in this regard.

Another weakness observed in Joseph is his lack of initiative. He often relies on explicit instructions rather than proactively identifying and addressing problems. This lack of ownership results in avoidable mistakes and places an additional burden on the team's time for validation.

Specific examples from this year further highlight Joseph's shortcomings:

Regarding Hub 2.0 tasks:

On 03/16, Joseph was assigned the task of reviewing links across Hub 2.0 for errors. Although the task was marked as complete on 03/20, it was executed poorly and remained incomplete until it had to be reviewed and redone.
During the critical Hub2.0 Delta Migration scheduled for the weekend of 05/05, Joseph failed to validate the results. Only after being instructed to do so on May 12th did he finally review and complete the migration.
On 05/02, Joseph was assigned the task of adding additional Bookmarks for Hub 2.0, along with explicit instructions on the required configurations. However, he missed the instructions during the initial attempt, and the task was only completed after a review and a request to fix the configuration.
Furthermore, other shortcomings include:

Despite receiving clear instructions via email to create an architectural document using a predefined template for Protected Vacation before the 04/28 meeting, Joseph completely missed the task. The deliverable was not completed until a week later.
Joseph's contributions during team discussions have been minimal or non-existent. This became evident during the TOPS Strategy Development Session on 01/25 when Joseph, when directly asked for his opinions, responded by saying he had 'nothing to add'. Additionally, during the TOPS Team SP Discussion meeting on 04/25, Joseph was the sole remote attendee. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the meeting room remained on mute for 45 minutes before other participants realized the issue. Joseph was unaware that the meeting was underway.
These examples highlight specific instances where Joseph's performance fell short, resulting in missed deadlines and incomplete tasks. It is crucial for Joseph to promptly address these areas of improvement to ensure better collaboration, increased productivity, and overall team success.
