Joseph is a senior technical resource who is a diligent worker and can produce good work. However, failure to work on his development areas discussed during his performance review is impacting our team’s performance.
One of Joseph's key development areas is effective communication. He often fails to communicate the status of his deliverables. This has led to incomplete deliverables and confusion about what needs to be done. Joseph has been informed about this issue in the past, but he has not made any improvements.
Another weakness of Joseph's is his lack of initiative. He often waits to be told what to do, rather than taking the initiative to figure out what needs to be done and needs to be more proactive in identifying and addressing problems. Joseph's work suffers from a lack of ownership and often does not take responsibility for his work and makes mistakes that could have been avoided. The deliverables must be validated which is a big strain on time for the team.
Here are specific examples from this year.

-	Joseph was tasked to review links across all of Hub 2.0 for errors on 03/16. The task was marked complete on 03/20. The task was executed poorly and remained incomplete till the task was reviewed.
-	Clear emailed instruction on creating architectural document for Protected Vacation was sent prior to the 04/28 meeting that was completely missed. The reformatted deliverable was not completed until a week after.

-	The task of adding additional Bookmarks for Hub 2.0 was assigned on May 2nd and explicit instructions were given on the configurations. The instructions were ignored during the first pass until fixing the configuration was requested a few days later.
