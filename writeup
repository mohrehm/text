On May 19, 2023, the default sharing setting in SharePoint will change. Instead of sharing files and folders with anyone who has the link, you will only be able to share them with people who are already part of your organization and have been invited to view them.


Joseph often fails to communicate the status of his deliverables. He does not keep others updated on his progress, and has been missing deadlines. This was a key development area highlighted during their performance review and no improventments have been observed. the following are instances where lapse of communication has been pronounce.
1- Team discussions 
	- Limited to no contributions during January 25th TOPS Strategy Development Session. 
	- TOPS Team SP Discussion Meeting (April 25th) went on for 45 minutes before the presenter realize that the room was on mute and Joseph couldnt hear the on going conversation.

Joseph, a senior technical resource, demonstrates diligence in his work and has the potential to deliver good results. However, his failure to address the development areas identified during his performance review is negatively impacting our team's overall performance.

One of Joseph's primary areas for improvement is effective communication. Unfortunately, he frequently neglects to communicate the status of his deliverables, resulting in incomplete tasks and confusion regarding the required actions. Although Joseph has been previously informed about this issue, he has not shown any noticeable improvements in this regard.

Another weakness observed in Joseph is his lack of initiative. He often relies on explicit instructions rather than proactively identifying and addressing problems. Taking ownership of his work is an area where Joseph struggles, leading to avoidable mistakes and a subsequent burden on the team's time for validation.

To provide specific examples from this year:

Missed deliverables related to Hub 2.0 tasks:
On 03/16, Joseph was assigned the task of reviewing links across Hub 2.0 for errors. The task was marked as complete on 03/20, but it was executed poorly and remained incomplete until it was reviewed again.
Despite receiving clear instructions via email to create an architectural document for Protected Vacation before the 04/28 meeting, Joseph completely missed the task. The deliverable was not completed until a week later.
For the Hub2.0 Delta Migration, a critical Go-Live activity scheduled for the weekend of May 5th to 7th, Joseph failed to complete the task. It was only after being instructed to do so on May 12th that he finally completed the migration.
On May 2nd, Joseph was assigned the task of adding additional Bookmarks for Hub 2.0, along with explicit instructions on the required configurations. However, he ignored the instructions during the initial attempt, and it was only after several days and a request to fix the configuration that he complied.
These examples highlight the specific instances where Joseph's performance fell short, resulting in missed deadlines and incomplete tasks. It is crucial for Joseph to address these areas of improvement promptly to ensure better collaboration, productivity, and overall team success.
