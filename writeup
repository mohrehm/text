On May 19, 2023, the default sharing setting in SharePoint will change. Instead of sharing files and folders with anyone who has the link, you will only be able to share them with people who are already part of your organization and have been invited to view them.


Joseph often fails to communicate the status of his deliverables. He does not keep others updated on his progress, and has been missing deadlines. This was a key development area highlighted during their performance review and no improventments have been observed. the following are instances where lapse of communication has been pronounce.
1- Team discussions 
	- Limited to no contributions during January 25th TOPS Strategy Development Session. 
	- TOPS Team SP Discussion Meeting (April 25th) went on for 45 minutes before the presenter realize that the room was on mute and Joseph couldnt hear the on going conversation.
2- Missed deliverablesstreamgovernanceTOPS Team SP Discussion 
	- Incomplete link correction task 
	- Incomplete Delta migration
	- Overlooking directions given 
		- for Architecture documents
		- for SharePoint Hub bookmarks - promoted links
	- Hub 2.0 Go-Live weekend testing
	- Incomplete/Incorrect deliverables during Protected Vacation security group reconnaisance
3- No visible efforts towards technical improvements.



Joseph, a senior technical resource, demonstrates diligence in his work and has the potential to deliver good results. However, his failure to address the development areas identified during his performance review is negatively impacting our team's overall performance.
One of Joseph's primary areas for improvement is effective communication. Unfortunately, he frequently neglects to communicate the status of his deliverables, resulting in incomplete tasks and confusion regarding the required actions. Although Joseph has been previously informed about this issue, he has not shown any noticeable improvements in this regard.
Another weakness observed in Joseph is his lack of initiative. He often relies on explicit instructions rather than proactively identifying and addressing problems. Taking ownership of his work is an area where Joseph struggles, leading to avoidable mistakes and a subsequent burden on the team's time for validation.
To provide specific examples from this year:
Missed deliverables related to Hub 2.0 tasks:
-	On 03/16, Joseph was assigned the task of reviewing links across Hub 2.0 for errors. The task was marked as complete on 03/20, but it was executed poorly and remained incomplete until it was reviewed again and redone.
-	For the Hub2.0 Delta Migration, a critical Go-Live activity scheduled for the weekend of 05/05, Joseph failed to validate the results. The migration had failed and it was only after being instructed to do so on May 12th that he finally reviewed and completed the migration.
-	On 05/02, Joseph was assigned the task of adding additional Bookmarks for Hub 2.0, along with explicit instructions on the required configurations. However, he missed the instructions during the initial attempt, and it was only after a review and a request to fix the configuration that the task was completed.
-	The team was on standby to test last minute configurations of Hub2.0 on the weekend of May 5th. Joseph was expected to be there with the entire team as we tested and met to talk through the findings. It wasn’t until later that Joseph joined on Go-Live testing.
Other short comings
-	Despite receiving clear instructions via email to create an architectural document using a predefined template for Protected Vacation before the 04/28 meeting, Joseph completely missed the task. The deliverable was not completed until a week later.
-	There are little to no contributions made by Joseph during team discussions. On 01/25, during TOPS Strategy Development Session, when directly asked for opinions, Joseph said he had ‘nothing to add’. Similarly on 04\25 during TOPS Team SP Discussion meeting, Joseph was the only remote attendee. The meeting room was mistakenly on mute for 45 minutes before other attendants realized the issue. 
These examples highlight the specific instances where Joseph's performance fell short, resulting in missed deadlines and incomplete tasks. It is crucial for Joseph to address these areas of improvement promptly to ensure better collaboration, productivity, and overall team success.
