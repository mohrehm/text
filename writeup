On May 19, 2023, the default sharing setting in SharePoint will change. 
Instead of sharing files and folders with anyone who has the link, 
you will only be able to share them with people who are already part of your organization and have been invited to view them.




After the change, when copying a link to a file or folder, the link will only work for people who have already been invited to share the file with before and are part of Harris Williams.
